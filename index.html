   <div><P><h2>Description - Seafood Risotto</h2></P></div>
    
    <p>This seafood risotto is easy to make and an excellent dish to make for a special dinner. The recipe is adaptable as well. You can use a simple combination of scallops, shrimp, and mussels, or use whatever combination of seafood you like. Clams, calamari, and chunks of flaky white fish are a few more possibilities. 
        You could even splurge and add some cooked lobster meat just before serving, or use only one kind of seafood in the dish.
        A good quality seafood stock is ideal, but you may use fish stock or vegetable broth if that's what you have on hand. Commercial stocks and broths can be salty, so make sure to taste the finished risotto before seasoning. For the best, creamiest risotto, use Italian short-grain arborio rice or medium-grain carnaroli rice.
        Serve this risotto with crusty bread and a tossed green salad or steamed vegetable, such as peas, asparagus, or green beans. Choose a crisp white wine to pair with seafood risotto, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, or a light-bodied vinho verde. A higher acid Chenin blanc is an excellent choice as well.</p>

    <div><p><h2>Description - Salmon sushi roll</h2></p></body></div>
        <P>Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!</P>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>6 sheets nori</li>
            <li>8 ounches smoked salmon</li>
            <li>1 cucumber</li>
            <li>1&frac12; Avocado</li>
        </ul>
            <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
            <Li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</Li>

    <div><P><h2>Description - Pan Seared Steak</h2></P></div>
        <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>  
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>2 Cups orange juice</li>
            <li>1 Cup applie cider vinegar</li>
            <li>&frac12; Cup worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1&frac12;Tablespoons steak seasoning</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
                Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
