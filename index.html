    <P><h2><em>Description - Seafood Risotto</em></h2></P>
    <p>This seafood risotto is easy to make and an excellent dish to make for a special dinner. The recipe is adaptable as well. You can use a simple combination of scallops, shrimp, and mussels, or use whatever combination of seafood you like. Clams, calamari, and chunks of flaky white fish are a few more possibilities. 
        You could even splurge and add some cooked lobster meat just before serving, or use only one kind of seafood in the dish.
        A good quality seafood stock is ideal, but you may use fish stock or vegetable broth if that's what you have on hand. Commercial stocks and broths can be salty, so make sure to taste the finished risotto before seasoning. For the best, creamiest risotto, use Italian short-grain arborio rice or medium-grain carnaroli rice.
        Serve this risotto with crusty bread and a tossed green salad or steamed vegetable, such as peas, asparagus, or green beans. Choose a crisp white wine to pair with seafood risotto, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, or a light-bodied vinho verde. A higher acid Chenin blanc is an excellent choice as well.</p>
